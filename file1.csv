"Preordered on 4th Aug. Received on 28th Aug.



This is my 4th Note device and coming from a Note 9, it is a brilliant upgrade, especially if you use the SPen a lot. I can't live without SPen and the Secure Folder (work folder).

In the box: Practically nothing but the phone, adapter, and wired earphones. Not even a case. Thankfully bought a case as well.
Looks and feel: Everything already known. The most premium phone you can buy in India right now. Feels awesome in hand, well balanced, mind-blowing screen, too smooth 120Hz display (you won't miss 2k resolution).
When you plan to watch Netflix youtube etc in full 4k resolution, change the resolution in the settings. There you don't need 120Hz refresh rate. Otherwise, adaptive refresh is something that should increase battery life.
Camera: Money's worth. any image looks wonderful on the screen though. 5x optical zoom is very useful. Night mode is good, close to pixel level but not better.
SPen, wayyyyy better than the Note 9 pen. Air gestures are very useful if you get used to them.

The phone may seem very costly but it is worth it in the long run. My Note 8 and Note 9 are still running very well. No issues whatsoever. So a note can easily run like new for 3 years. Samsung is also giving 3 Android updates for the first time.",4
"It is a great phone, but grossly overpriced. Similarly specced s series phones are cheaper. The display is great but you can either choose 120hz or qhd+ which is sad. Phones like one plus 8 pro offer this at half the price. I brought this for the s pen and novelty features offered by Samsung like dex, better integration of certain apps with windows ecosystem etc. But you really need to evaluate whether these features are worth the extra money. I have used the spen couple of times since I brought this and never used dex as of now. One UI is clean and fast but so are other skins like oxygen os so no brownie points there. I love the camera it gives a nice natural bokeh the ui is good too. The greatest weakness for this phone is the battery life. It is strictly a one day phone with light usage, with heavy usage the battery will give up on you by late evening. I suspect this is mainly due to the battery hogging exynos chip. I have not experienced any lags but that is expected when you spend more than a lac for a device. The design is great but what's the point when you'll slap a case on it anyway. My 2 cents save your money go for the one plus 8pro or anything similar which has snapdragon chips or go for the iphone you'll get all what you want and save some money.",4
"Excellent Note .....it is a note so everything is really big.....like really big screen , camera bump ...so on....battery is not the best but good it lasts whole day ......there is no question about the camera one of the best .....pro video has 120fps video recording support which is insane .....smooth screen and surfing ....speakers good ...display is the best in any smartphone......the phone is simply amazing but has the most obvious disappointment..that is the cheaper cooling system...the phone gets really hot and drains battery even on Wi-Fi usage which is really embarrassing for a 1lakh phone...hopefully Samsung will make some updates available to address the issue.
Camera: 5/5
Display:5/5
Speakers:4/5
Battery:4/5
Design: 5/5
Cooling system: 2.5/5 (phone gets heated even on minimal use)
Which is really disappointing...
Price is a bit unfair.
Overall one of the best Android smartphone out there easily.",5
"This is the best Smartphone to purchase if you are into vlogging...
I ran a YouTube channel with 2 lakh plus subs and using this device for shooting videos... The Live Focus feature in video is the best thing I liked is that it give bokeh in video...
S Pen is awesome... And beneficial in video editing...
Battery is descent...
Overall its a good buy. And at last you will love it",5
"I have always used the Galaxy S lineups, but this is the first note I am using. I would say this is the best thing Samsung has ever did since the S8+ . A beautiful phone with a beast like performance. The design, the display, the S-pen functionality, everything ahout the note is perfect. Although some of the macro shots fail to impress, I would rather say that the camera's performance is awesome as it delivers the best of the pictures.",5
"I've ordered a week back and so far, things are going so good with my Note 20 Ultra. This phone actually stays a step ahead of what other smartphones usually do. A-Z things can be done with this phone, and in fact I might take even a month to explore all of the hidden features.

Samsung shipping Exynos processor in India, is one big minus though. But if you're not a big gamer or a heavy camera user, this should suit your purpose.

I know Apple iPhone 12 is about to launch, but for sure until iPhone 15 series, this Note 20 Ultra specs will remain top in the list.",5
Excellent,5

"Good buy

Writing review after 15 days of usage..

Awesome Flagship phone from Samsung. When it come to note series the best thing is S-pen, 9 ms response, is just impressive, the best feature..

Second is camera, great quality of photos and videos 50x zoom is fair enough, meanwhile the camera patch on the back of the Note 20 Ultra can be deal breaker if u are not using a backcover..

Crystal crisp 120 Hz display..both QHD & 120 Hz modes are spectacular to watch..

Waiting for an update for better battery life with exynos 990 (why no snapdragon to India)

Overall good experience so far

Pros
Dynamic 6.9-inch 120Hz display
Smoother S Pen performance
Bixby routine, focus mode and smart pop-up are usefull
Powerful 50x zoom camera and laser autofocus

Cons
Expensive
Camera bump is pretty big
Curved display can annoy at times when using S-pen",5

"Powerhouse

Certainly the best android phone out there. Could easily double up as a computer. Smooth 120Hz refresh rate goes well with Samsung's best-in-class display panel. However, getting Exynos 990 instead of the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 865+ in the Indian market is a bummer, and battery life could be an issue for heavy users.",5
"1. Camera - 5/5
2. Performance - 5/5
3. Battery backup - 4/5
4. S - Pen - 5/5
5. Heating issues - Sometimes.",5
"Note 20 Ultra 5G was a big wait.
Smartphone is very good in look and also love the camera bump.
All 10/10

Only battery is not so good early drain for heavy users.
Anyways purchased a wireless powerbank with it gives 14500 mAh. Battery together. Must buy.

No clues how to redeem E-Shop voucher. Please share knowledge.",5
Best of de best....,5
"Pros :

Display - best display on any smartphone on the planet. 5/5

Camera - the camera is fantastic. Lot of features to explore. Doesn't disappoint in any lighting condition. 5/5

Features - Overloaded with all features you would ever need on a smartphone. The average user might not use many features. But good to have thinks like spen, gestures, dex, reverse wireless charging, ip68,etc. 5/5

Performance - 99% of the times butter smooth. Noticed lag sometimes on multitasking. 4/5


Cons :

Heating : Phone gets warm with normal usage. Phone got hot with heavy usage. Overall, cooling system could have been better.

Battery : battery drain is real. Exynos SOT is 4-5 hours tops. Heavy users will need to charge twice a day.

Verdict :

For a 1L phone, it is packed with all features you will ever need on a smartphone. Exynos 990 is inferior compared to the snapdragon 865+ chipset which is a point of concern. Battery life could have been better. If you are a power user and plan to use this phone for official use, the features are unparalleled. If you are an average user, better wait for the 2021 Galaxy S series or the iPhone 12 series.

P.S - Seamlessly pairs with Galaxy watch 3.",4
